# examples/01-gdml:
  ##rewrote main.cc to have UI and rewrote vis macros to work##
  # to prove you can ingest a realistic detector-stand geometry via GDML and run particles through it.
            #Geometry hierarchy:  main.gdml composes modules (cryostat, holder, wrap, source) into a world.
	      #Materials + overlaps: duplicate material names warning; tiny overlaps cause tracking artifacts.
	 	#Vertex confinement efficiency: geometric acceptance of defined source volume.
  # Run run.mac (batch) and confirm stablity / Switch generator in macros (GPS) between gammas/electrons/ions and observe interaction signatures / Add a thin dead layer or change material and watch gross rate changes (systematics intuition).



# examples/02-hpge:
  #*created script analyze_hpge_hdf5.ipynb*# 
  #*The geometry + physics + generator parts in run.mac are fine.*#
  #*The vis macros do their own /run/initialize and then set up visualization + (for vis-traj.mac) define a GPS source and run /run/beamOn 100.*#
  # to define an HPGe detector (geometry + sensitive detector + scoring) and learn which quantities can output
		#Energy deposition in active Ge (spectrum shape)
		#Single-site vs multi-site behavior (Compton vs photoelectric)
		#How geometry changes peak efficiency
  # this is the core of LEGEND-style “what deposits near Q_ββ” thinking.



# examples/03-optics: 
  # LAr veto, Optical photons and scintillation/absorption.
    # Optical photon tracking + PMT/SiPM or optical surfaces / Storing optical observables into ROOT
    # How optical transport depends on surface definitions (polish, reflectivity).
    # Why optical simulation is expensive and requires careful reduction/observables.
  # LEGEND uses LAr veto concepts; optical response matters when you interpret veto performance, light yield, and veto coincidence rates, this is the conceptual bridge to LEGEND LAr veto light collection and surface modeling



# examples/04-cosmogenics:
  # Cosmogenic production/activation and/or cosmogenic event generation.
      # Activate isotopes, or simulate cosmogenic-induced decays in/near HPGe detectors.
      # Which isotopes dominate in Ge for your exposure assumptions
      # How delayed backgrounds arise from activation products.
  # Cosmogenic isotopes drive background models.




# examples/05-MUSUN: 
  # to use an external muon generator input (MUSUN CSV) to drive the simulation for u nderground muon backgrounds.
	# muons are sampled from a precomputed distribution (energy, angle, position)
	# remage generator reads and injects muons accordingly
	# Muon-induced backgrounds are geometry-dependent and rare but high-impact.
	# external muon spectrum → event injection → secondaries → detector response.
      # Secondary neutrons and gammas as a function of material around detector
	# modeling muon flux and angular distribution is essential for background budgets.
  # cosmogenic + muon-induced backgrounds and veto strategies.



# examples/06-NeutronCapture:
  # to validate neutron capture models and gamma cascades in materials.
	# simulating n-capture
	# recording which isotopes captured
	# recording gamma cascade properties
	# Capture gamma cascades are a major background mechanism.
	# How to implement a custom output scheme for specific physics questions (isotope accounting).
	# Neutron capture in materials (Cu, SS, Ar, etc.) creates gamma lines and Compton continua near ROI.
  # material choice + neutron moderation strategy

remage-systematically:
Step 1 — Geometry sanity + reproducibility
	•	Always run a batch macro first (no UI) and confirm:
	    •	overlap check is clean enough for tracking
	    •	event rate is stable
	•	Fix geometry before physics. Otherwise you chase ghosts.
Step 2 — Single-process intuition (HPGe)
    Run monoenergetic gammas and electrons and build intuition:
    	•	Photopeak vs Compton continuum (gamma)
	    •	Bremsstrahlung + MCS + range (electron)
	    •	Sensitivity to dead layer / holder material
Step 3 — Add realistic sources (decays, chains)
	•	Use BxDecay0 / built-in decay machinery where appropriate
	•	Compare “truth-level emission” vs “detected deposition”
Step 4 — Add correlated handles (tracks, timing, veto)
	•	Turn on track output schemes where available
	•	For LAr optics: treat “light yield → veto” as a physics handle

LEGEND-200:
  What backgrounds survive all cuts near Q_ββ?
    In simulation lingo:
	  •	Generate backgrounds in the correct place (materials and surfaces).
	  •	Transport them through the real geometry.
	  •	Record observables used in analysis: energy in detectors, multiplicity, distances, timing/veto flags.
  What is the signal efficiency?
	  •	Generate 0νββ decays in active volume.
	  •	Track energy depositions and topology proxies (multi-site vs single-site).
	  •	Include detector effects later (resolution, thresholds).
